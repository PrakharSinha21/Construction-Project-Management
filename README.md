# Construction-Project-Management

##Project Overview

This project analyzes construction project management data to optimize workflows, track task progress, and identify key issues. Using Python, we extract insights from project data to improve efficiency and reduce risks in construction projects.

##Features & Analysis

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, correcting data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, priority distributions, and project performance.

Visualizations: Bar charts, pie charts, and trend graphs for better insights.

Task Categorization: Grouping tasks by priority, cause, and status.

Optimization: Insights to improve efficiency and safety in construction processes.

##Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis
